            <p>I am a Junior Front-End Engineer. For the last several years, I have been
                inspired by my brother, (as a game designer) and my friend (as a distributed systems engineer).
                <br> 
                Finally, this year I felt my wind of changes. That is why I am now here. For more details about my path, you may see
                below in the experience column.
                <br>Previously, I worked as a Maritime Officer with experience of 5+years. Here I received mostly soft skills I poses now. </p>
